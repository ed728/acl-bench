# acl-bench
##Build
You need to set-up ACL_ROOT to point wherever your ACL checkout is, and it must have been already built.
To build this benchmark run either:

make ACL_ROOT=<YOUR_ACL>

OR

export ACL_ROOT=<YOUR_ACL>  
make

##Info
This currently only supports running with ConvolutionLayer as that was the main purpose. It will be updated to support the rest ASAP.
